1. Explore and experiment with Spotify API using Spotipy wrapper. 
2. I want to create playlists for myself without having to manually sort through my "Liked Songs". Creating playlists and adding songs one by one seems tedious since I haven't created have any playlists before. My taste in music varies and there comes a point where shuffle ruins the vibe with such dramatic changes.
3. If I have time, I want to create genre subgroups in order to follow the evolution of a genere (old school cumbia vs newer cumbia). Actually, this might be a classification problem... mmm, lets see how this goes lol 
4. Further steps would be to be able to compare two Spotify accounts to suggest songs you would both like and that maybe you haven't heard before.
